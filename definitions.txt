Disease - A disease is a sustained alteration in the normal structure or function of the cardiovascular system that produces clinical signs, symptoms, or laboratory abnormalities, and is not attributable to physiological variations, injury, or transient insults. In the heart disease context, it encompasses disorders such as myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy, valvular abnormalities, and arrhythmogenic conditions that result from genetic, inflammatory, ischemic, or hemodynamic mechanisms.
Disorder - A disorder is a pathological alteration in the structure or function of the cardiovascular system that deviates from normal physiology and produces clinical consequences, without necessarily fulfilling criteria for a specific disease entity or syndrome. It denotes a medically recognized abnormal state that may be reversible, chronic, or progressive, and is distinguished from transient injuries, normal variants, and well‑defined disease diagnoses.
Arrhythmia - An arrhythmia is a disturbance in the normal sequence or rate of cardiac electrical activation that results in irregular, too fast (tachyarrhythmia), or too slow (bradyarrhythmia) heartbeats. It reflects abnormal impulse generation, conduction, or both, and is distinct from structural heart disease or isolated conduction blocks, which are separate entities.
Aortic Disease - Aortic disease encompasses pathological conditions of the aorta—such as aneurysm, dissection, coarctation, stenosis, and inflammatory or degenerative disorders—characterized by structural weakening, dilation, tearing, or obstruction of the vessel wall, leading to compromised hemodynamic integrity. It is a distinct vascular disease entity separate from peripheral arterial disease and valvular heart disease.
Abdominal aortic aneurysm - Abdominal aortic aneurysm is a localized dilatation of the abdominal segment of the aorta, typically defined as a diameter ≥1.5 times the expected normal size (≥3 cm), that predisposes to progressive expansion and potential rupture. It differs from thoracic aortic aneurysm in anatomic location and from peripheral arterial disease in etiology, and is classified as a vascular disease of the aorta.
Thoracic aortic aneurysm - Thoracic aortic aneurysm is a focal dilation of the thoracic portion of the aorta measuring at least 1.5 times the normal diameter, reflecting structural weakness of the aortic wall that predisposes to dissection or rupture. It is a vascular disease that may arise idiopathically or in association with connective‑tissue disorders, hypertension, or atherosclerotic degeneration.
Ascending aortic aneurysm - An ascending aortic aneurysm is a focal dilation of the ascending portion of the aorta proximal to the aortic arch, defined by a diameter at least 1.5 times normal (typically >4.5 cm in adults) and associated with medial degeneration, hypertension, bicuspid aortic valve, or connective‑tissue disorders. It is a cardiovascular disease that predisposes to aortic dissection, rupture, and aortic valve insufficiency, and is distinguished from descending thoracic or abdominal aortic aneurysms by its specific anatomic location and hemodynamic stresses.
Descending thoracic aortic aneurysm - A descending thoracic aortic aneurysm is a pathological dilation of the descending portion of the thoracic aorta—usually distal to the left subclavian artery and proximal to the diaphragmatic hiatus—whose diameter exceeds 1.5 times the expected normal size. This vascular disorder predisposes to rupture, dissection, and distal embolic complications.
Aortic arch aneurysm - Aortic arch aneurysm is a focal dilatation of the aortic arch segment exceeding 1.5 times its expected normal diameter, resulting from weakening of the medial layer of the vessel wall. It is a subset of thoracic aortic aneurysms distinguished by its location proximal to the origins of the supra‑aortic branches and carries a heightened risk of rupture, dissection, or embolic complications.
Aortic root aneurysm - An aortic root aneurysm is a focal dilatation of the aortic root—including the sinuses of Valsalva, sinotubular junction, and adjacent valve annulus—exceeding normal dimensions by >50 % or reaching a diameter typically >4.5 cm, thereby increasing the risk of aortic insufficiency, dissection, or rupture. It is distinguished from an ascending aortic aneurysm, which involves the tubular segment distal to the sinotubular junction.
Aortic dissection - Aortic dissection is an acute vascular emergency in which a tear in the intimal layer of the aorta allows blood to enter and separate the media, creating a false lumen that may propagate longitudinally. The condition can compromise branch vessel perfusion, lead to aneurysmal dilation, or cause rupture, distinguishing it from aortic aneurysm, which is a focal dilatation without intimal disruption. It is classified as a life‑threatening aortic disease requiring emergent diagnosis and management.
Aortic intramural hematoma - Aortic intramural hematoma is a localized collection of blood within the media layer of the aortic wall without an intimal tear, resulting from rupture of the vasa vasorum or small penetrating arteries. It is classified as a variant of acute aortic syndrome and differs from classic aortic dissection by the absence of a true luminal flap, and from penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer by lacking an ulcerated atherosclerotic plaque.
Aortic rupture - Aortic rupture is an acute, often fatal disruption of the aortic wall integrity resulting in extrusion of blood into surrounding tissues or body cavities. It differs from aortic dissection, which involves separation of the medial layer without full-thickness tear, and may occur spontaneously, secondary to an aneurysm, trauma, or iatrogenic injury. The condition constitutes a medical emergency characterized by hemodynamic instability and rapid hemorrhage.
Aortopathy - Aortopathy refers to any disease process that alters the structural integrity, mechanical properties, or geometry of the aortic wall, encompassing conditions such as congenital connective‑tissue abnormalities, inflammatory aortitis, aneurysmal dilation, and dissection. It is distinguished from isolated aortic valve disease by involving the arterial segment itself rather than valve leaflets or function.
Peripheral Vascular Disease - Peripheral Vascular Disease is a chronic atherosclerotic disorder causing progressive obstruction or narrowing of the peripheral arteries, most often those of the lower extremities, which results in reduced perfusion, ischemic claudication, and heightened risk of distal ulceration or gangrene. It is a distinct vascular disease separate from coronary or cerebrovascular atherosclerosis, reflecting systemic arterial pathology.
Peripheral arterial disease - Peripheral arterial disease is a systemic atherosclerotic disorder characterized by progressive stenosis or occlusion of the extracranial arteries supplying the lower extremities, resulting in reduced limb perfusion and ischemic symptoms such as intermittent claudication. It is distinguished from coronary artery disease by its primary involvement of peripheral arterial vessels rather than the coronary circulation, and from venous insufficiency by its arterial etiology and associated hemodynamic compromise.
Peripheral artery disease - Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a chronic atherosclerotic occlusive disorder of the arteries supplying the lower extremities, in which progressive luminal narrowing impairs perfusion and produces ischemic manifestations such as intermittent claudication, rest pain, and potential tissue loss. It is differentiated from other atherosclerotic conditions by its primary involvement of peripheral, rather than coronary or cerebrovascular, vessels.
Critical limb ischemia - Critical limb ischemia is the advanced clinical manifestation of peripheral arterial disease in which chronic arterial insufficiency produces ischemic rest pain, non‑healing ulceration, or gangrene persisting for >2 weeks. It denotes severe, occlusive atherosclerotic obstruction of limb vessels and is distinguished from intermittent claudication by the presence of persistent tissue loss or rest discomfort.
Large-Vessel Atherosclerotic Disease - Large‑vessel atherosclerotic disease denotes the development of atherosclerotic plaques that cause stenosis, occlusion, or aneurysmal change in major arterial trunks—including the aorta, brachiocephalic, carotid, subclavian, and proximal segments of coronary, renal, and peripheral arteries—resulting in compromised blood flow and heightened risk of ischemic events.
Atherosclerosis - Atherosclerosis is a chronic, progressive arterial disease characterized by the accumulation of lipid‑laden fibro‑intimal plaques within the tunica intima of medium and large arteries, leading to luminal narrowing, impaired vascular compliance, and predisposition to thrombosis or plaque rupture. It is distinguished from arteriosclerosis, which denotes generalized arterial stiffening without necessarily involving lipid plaques.
Atrial Arrhythmias - Atrial arrhythmias are cardiac rhythm disturbances originating in the atrial myocardium, characterized by abnormal initiation or propagation of electrical impulses that disrupt normal sinus rhythm and atrial contraction. They encompass a spectrum of disorders such as atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, and ectopic atrial tachycardia, and are distinguished from ventricular arrhythmias by their atrial focus and impact on atrioventricular conduction. These conditions constitute a class of cardiac electrical diseases that increase the risk of thromboembolic events and hemodynamic compromise.
Atrial fibrillation - Atrial fibrillation is a supraventricular tachyarrhythmia marked by chaotic atrial depolarization, loss of discernible P waves, and an irregularly irregular ventricular response on electrocardiogram. It increases the risk of thromboembolic events and may lead to hemodynamic instability.
Atrial flutter - Atrial flutter is a supraventricular tachyarrhythmia characterized by a rapid, regular atrial depolarization rate (typically 250–350 beats/min) produced by a macro‑reentrant circuit, most commonly within the cavotricuspid isthmus of the right atrium. This organized rhythm leads to a fixed atrioventricular conduction ratio (often 2:1), resulting in a regular ventricular response that distinguishes it from the irregularly irregular conduction of atrial fibrillation.
Supraventricular Arrhythmias - Supraventricular arrhythmias are abnormal cardiac rhythm disturbances originating in atrial tissue, the atrioventricular node, or the proximal His‑Purkinje system, resulting in premature, rapid, or irregular activation of the ventricles. They encompass a spectrum of tachyarrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, atrioventricular nodal re‑entrant tachycardia, and atrial tachycardia, differentiating them from ventricular arrhythmias that arise from ventricular myocardium.
Supraventricular tachycardia - Supraventricular tachycardia is a cardiac arrhythmia arising from tissue above the atrioventricular node, most often presenting with a regular rhythm exceeding 100 beats/min and narrow QRS complexes on electrocardiogram. It is a tachyarrhythmic disorder of the atria or atrioventricular junction that can produce palpitations, hemodynamic instability, or syncope.
Ventricular Arrhythmias - Abnormal heart rhythms originating in the ventricular myocardium, including premature ventricular contractions, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation, that disrupt normal ventricular depolarization and repolarization and can precipitate hemodynamic instability or sudden cardiac death; they are distinguished from supraventricular arrhythmias by their ventricular focus and often more severe clinical consequences.
Ventricular tachycardia - Ventricular tachycardia is a tachyarrhythmia defined by three or more consecutive ventricular depolarizations at a rate usually exceeding 100 beats/min, originating from an abnormal focus or re‑entrant circuit within the ventricular myocardium. It may be sustained (>30 seconds) or nonsustained and is distinguished from ventricular fibrillation by the presence of organized QRS complexes and from supraventricular tachycardia by its ventricular origin.
Ventricular fibrillation - Ventricular fibrillation is a rapid, disorganized electrical activity of the ventricular myocardium that abolishes coordinated contraction, leading to an abrupt cessation of effective cardiac output. It constitutes a life‑threatening cardiac arrhythmia that requires immediate defibrillation to restore organized rhythm.
Conduction System Disorder - A conduction system disorder is a pathological condition affecting the cardiac conduction pathways—such as the sinoatrial node, atrioventricular node, bundle of His, and Purkinje network—that impairs the generation or propagation of electrical impulses, leading to abnormal heart rhythms. It is distinguished from primary arrhythmias caused by metabolic, autonomic, or extrinsic factors by originating from intrinsic structural or functional abnormalities of the conduction tissue.
Sick sinus syndrome - Sick sinus syndrome is a disorder of sinoatrial node function that produces inappropriate sinus bradycardia, sinus pauses, or alternating brady‑tachyarrhythmias (tachy‑brady syndrome), resulting in failure of adequate heart‑rate regulation. It reflects intrinsic degeneration or metabolic impairment of the primary cardiac pacemaker.
Coronary Ischemic Disease - Coronary ischemic disease is a chronic atherosclerotic disorder of the coronary arteries that diminishes myocardial perfusion enough to produce myocardial ischemia, manifested as stable angina, silent ischemia, or myocardial infarction. It is distinguished from acute coronary syndromes, which involve plaque rupture and thrombotic occlusion leading to abrupt clinical events.
Coronary artery disease - Coronary artery disease is a chronic atherosclerotic disorder characterized by the accumulation of lipid‑rich plaques within the epicardial coronary arteries, producing luminal narrowing, reduced myocardial perfusion, and risk of myocardial ischemia. It is distinct from acute coronary syndromes, which represent the clinical sequelae of plaque rupture or thrombosis, and from congenital coronary anomalies that are non‑atherosclerotic.
Ischemic heart disease - Ischemic heart disease is a spectrum of coronary artery disorders characterized by reduced myocardial blood flow due to atherosclerotic narrowing or occlusion of the coronary arteries, leading to myocardial oxygen supply–demand mismatch. It encompasses clinical entities such as stable angina, acute coronary syndromes, and silent myocardial ischemia, and is distinct from non‑ischemic cardiomyopathies that arise without coronary artery obstruction.
Ischemia with nonobstructive coronary arteries - Ischemia with nonobstructive coronary arteries (INOCA) denotes myocardial ischemia that is confirmed by objective testing (e.g., stress imaging, coronary physiology) despite angiographic findings of normal or minimally stenotic epicardial coronary vessels, usually defined as luminal narrowing < 50 %. It represents a clinical syndrome distinct from obstructive coronary artery disease and encompasses pathophysiologic mechanisms such as coronary microvascular dysfunction and vasospasm.
Myocardial ischemia - Myocardial ischemia is a condition in which myocardial tissue receives insufficient blood flow to meet its metabolic demands, typically due to partial obstruction of coronary arteries. This perfusion deficit leads to transient oxygen deprivation without necessarily causing irreversible necrosis, distinguishing it from myocardial infarction, which involves permanent cell death. It may be precipitated by atherosclerotic plaque, coronary spasm, or embolic obstruction.
Acute Coronary Syndrome - Acute coronary syndrome denotes a spectrum of clinical presentations—including unstable angina, non‑ST‑segment elevation myocardial infarction, and ST‑segment elevation myocardial infarction—caused by abrupt reduction of coronary blood flow secondary to atherosclerotic plaque disruption, thrombosis, or embolism, leading to myocardial ischemia and necrosis. It is distinguished from chronic stable angina by the sudden onset, evolving electrocardiographic changes, and elevated cardiac biomarkers indicative of acute myocardial injury.
Unstable angina - Unstable angina is an acute coronary syndrome characterized by a recent increase in the frequency, duration, or intensity of myocardial ischemic discomfort at rest or with minimal exertion, without persistent myocardial necrosis as evidenced by normal cardiac biomarkers. It reflects a transient reduction in coronary blood flow due to plaque disruption, thrombosis, or vasospasm and is distinguished from stable angina by its unpredictable nature and from myocardial infarction by the absence of irreversible myocardial injury.
Myocardial infarction - Myocardial infarction is the irreversible necrosis of cardiac myocytes caused by prolonged ischemia due to abrupt reduction or cessation of coronary blood flow, typically from thrombotic occlusion of an epicardial artery. The extent of necrosis correlates with the duration and severity of the perfusion deficit, producing characteristic electrocardiographic changes, biomarker elevation, and clinical manifestations of acute coronary syndrome.
Chronic Ischemic Syndrome - A chronic ischemic syndrome is a clinical condition in which persistent myocardial perfusion deficiency caused by obstructive coronary atherosclerosis produces predictable exertional angina, dyspnea, or reproducible ischemic electrocardiographic changes without evidence of acute plaque rupture. It is distinguished from acute coronary syndrome by its stable, long‑standing nature and the absence of acute myocardial injury.
Stable angina - Stable angina is a recurrent, predictable chest discomfort or pressure that arises when myocardial oxygen demand exceeds supply due to fixed atherosclerotic narrowing of coronary arteries, and that is relieved promptly by rest or nitroglycerin. It is distinguished from unstable angina by its stable, exertion‑linked pattern and lack of acute plaque disruption.
Cerebrovascular Ischemic Disease - Cerebrovascular ischemic disease denotes a spectrum of disorders in which arterial occlusion, thrombosis, embolism, or high‑grade atherosclerotic stenosis of cerebral vessels results in reduced cerebral perfusion and tissue infarction, encompassing acute ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack. It is distinguished from hemorrhagic cerebrovascular conditions by the absence of intracerebral bleeding and primarily involves ischemic mechanisms that share atherosclerotic risk profile with systemic cardiovascular disease.
Ischemic stroke - An ischemic stroke is an acute cerebrovascular event caused by obstruction of a cerebral artery—commonly from a cardio‑embolic source such as atrial fibrillation—resulting in focal brain tissue infarction due to ischemia. It is distinguished from hemorrhagic stroke, which arises from intracerebral bleeding rather than arterial occlusion.
Hemorrhagic stroke - Hemorrhagic stroke is an acute cerebrovascular disease in which rupture of an intracerebral artery, arteriolar, or venous vessel results in extravasation of blood into the brain parenchyma, subarachnoid space, or ventricles, causing sudden neurological impairment. It is distinguished from ischemic stroke by the presence of intracranial hemorrhage rather than arterial occlusion.
Atherosclerosis - Atherosclerosis is a chronic, progressive disease of medium and large arteries in which lipid‑rich, fibrous plaques accumulate within the intimal layer, causing luminal narrowing, endothelial dysfunction, and susceptibility to plaque rupture. It is the primary substrate for coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular ischemia, and peripheral arterial occlusive disease.
Ischemic disease - Ischemic disease denotes a spectrum of pathological conditions in which tissue or organ function is compromised due to blood flow that is insufficient to meet metabolic demand, typically caused by arterial narrowing, occlusion, or embolism. In cardiovascular medicine it includes entities such as coronary artery disease, peripheral arterial disease, and cerebral ischemia, distinguishing them from non‑ischemic cardiomyopathies that arise without flow limitation.
Heart Failure - Heart failure is a clinical syndrome resulting from structural or functional cardiac abnormalities that impair the ventricle’s ability to generate adequate forward flow to satisfy the metabolic needs of the body, producing symptoms such as dyspnea, fatigue, and peripheral edema. It is distinguished from acute myocardial injury or coronary artery disease by its primary manifestation of reduced cardiac output and/or elevated filling pressures rather than ischemic necrosis.
Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction - Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction is a clinical syndrome in which left ventricular systolic dysfunction leads to an ejection fraction ≤40%, resulting in inadequate cardiac output to meet systemic metabolic demands. It is distinguished from heart failure with preserved ejection fraction by the presence of impaired contractility rather than isolated diastolic dysfunction. This condition is classified as a form of systolic heart failure and constitutes a specific disease entity within cardiovascular medicine.
Ischemic heart failure - Ischemic heart failure is a clinical syndrome of left ventricular systolic dysfunction caused by chronic myocardial ischemia secondary to obstructive coronary artery disease, frequently following myocardial infarction. It is distinguished from non‑ischemic heart failure by the presence of coronary artery pathology as the primary etiologic factor and is typically associated with reduced ejection fraction and signs of congestion.
Cardiogenic shock - Cardiogenic shock is a life‑threatening state of systemic hypoperfusion caused by primary failure of the heart’s pumping ability, resulting in markedly reduced cardiac output, hypotension, and inadequate tissue oxygen delivery despite normal or elevated preload. It is distinguished from other forms of shock by its origin in intrinsic myocardial dysfunction rather than hypovolemia, distributive, or obstructive mechanisms.
Cardiomyopathy - Cardiomyopathy denotes a heterogeneous group of myocardial diseases characterized by abnormal cardiac muscle structure and impaired contractile function that cannot be explained by coronary artery disease, hypertension, valvular disease, or congenital heart anomalies. These intrinsic myocardial abnormalities lead to ventricular dilatation, hypertrophy, or restrictive filling patterns, ultimately compromising systolic and/or diastolic performance.
Primary Cardiomyopathy - Primary cardiomyopathy is a myocardial disease originating from intrinsic abnormalities of the cardiac muscle, without attributable systemic, ischemic, valvular, hypertensive, or congenital causes. It manifests as structural and functional impairment of the heart, often genetic or idiopathic, and is classified as a primary cardiac disease.
Dilated cardiomyopathy - Dilated cardiomyopathy is a primary myocardial disease marked by dilation of one or both ventricular chambers, particularly the left ventricle, accompanied by impaired systolic contraction and reduced ejection fraction, which predisposes to heart failure and arrhythmia. It is classified as a non‑ischemic cardiomyopathy and may be idiopathic or secondary to genetic, infectious, toxic, metabolic, or other systemic causes.
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy - Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a primarily genetic myocardial disorder defined by unexplained, often asymmetric, left ventricular hypertrophy—most frequently of the interventricular septum—in the absence of systemic or other cardiac causes, resulting in diastolic dysfunction and, in many cases, left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.
Restrictive cardiomyopathy - Restrictive cardiomyopathy is a primary myocardial disorder characterized by increased ventricular stiffness and impaired diastolic filling despite near‑normal systolic function and wall thickness, leading to elevated atrial pressures and reduced cardiac output. It is distinguished from hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathies by its predominant restriction of ventricular compliance without significant chamber dilation or hypertrophy.
Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy - Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy is an inherited myocardial disorder characterized by fibro‑fatty replacement of right ventricular myocardium, leading to regional wall motion abnormalities, ventricular dilatation, and a propensity for ventricular tachyarrhythmias. It is distinct from dilated cardiomyopathy by its predominant right‑ventricular involvement and from myocarditis by the absence of active inflammation. The condition predisposes affected individuals to sudden cardiac death, particularly during exertion.
Left ventricular noncompaction - Left ventricular noncompaction is a congenital cardiomyopathy characterized by a bilayered myocardial architecture with a thin compacted outer layer and a markedly thickened non‑compacted inner layer containing prominent trabeculations and deep intertrabecular recesses that communicate with the ventricular cavity. Diagnosis is distinguished from other cardiomyopathies by imaging criteria, typically a non‑compacted-to-compacted myocardial thickness ratio ≥ 2:1 in end‑systole. The structural abnormality predisposes to systolic and diastolic dysfunction, arrhythmias, and systemic embolization.
Secondary Cardiomyopathy - A secondary cardiomyopathy is a disease characterized by ventricular structural and functional abnormalities that arise as a consequence of identifiable systemic disorders, infiltrative processes, metabolic derangements, drug toxicity, or other primary cardiac conditions, distinguishing it from primary (idiopathic) cardiomyopathies where no external cause is evident.
Ischemic cardiomyopathy - Ischemic cardiomyopathy is a structural heart disease defined by left ventricular systolic dysfunction and remodeling that arises from chronic myocardial ischemia secondary to coronary artery disease, frequently following myocardial infarction. It is distinguished from non‑ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy by the presence of underlying atherosclerotic coronary lesions and scarred myocardium attributable to prior ischemic injury.
Cardiac amyloidosis - Cardiac amyloidosis is an infiltrative cardiomyopathy characterized by extracellular deposition of amyloid fibrils within the myocardium, leading to progressive ventricular wall thickening, diastolic dysfunction, and conduction system abnormalities. The condition results from systemic amyloidogenic disorders (e.g., light‑chain or transthyretin amyloidosis) that produce misfolded protein aggregates that accumulate in cardiac tissue. It is distinguished from other restrictive cardiomyopathies by the presence of amyloid‑specific histologic staining and, often, associated extracardiac amyloid manifestations.
Cardiac sarcoidosis - Cardiac sarcoidosis is a granulomatous inflammatory disorder in which non‑caseating epithelioid granulomas infiltrate myocardial tissue, often leading to conduction system disease, ventricular arrhythmias, or systolic dysfunction. It represents an organ‑specific manifestation of systemic sarcoidosis but may occur in isolation, distinguishing it from other infiltrative cardiomyopathies such as amyloidosis or hemochromatosis.
Familial Cardiomyopathy - Familial cardiomyopathy refers to a genetically inherited myocardial disorder characterized by structural and functional abnormalities of the heart muscle that are transmitted in an autosomal dominant, recessive, or X‑linked pattern within affected families, distinguishing it from sporadic cardiomyopathies of unknown or non‑hereditary origin.
Ventricular Structural Disorder - Ventricular structural disorder denotes any pathological alteration in the size, shape, wall thickness, or myocardial architecture of the left or right ventricle—such as dilatation, hypertrophy, aneurysm, scar formation, or congenital malformation—that persists independently of transient loading conditions and can impair ventricular contractile performance.
Ventricular Hypertrophy - Ventricular hypertrophy is the pathological enlargement of myocardial mass in one or both ventricles, manifested as thickened ventricular walls and a proportionate reduction in chamber volume, typically resulting from chronic pressure overload (e.g., systemic hypertension, aortic stenosis) or volume overload (e.g., valvular regurgitation). It is distinct from ventricular dilation, which involves chamber enlargement without increased wall thickness.
Left ventricular hypertrophy - Left ventricular hypertrophy is the adaptive increase in myocardial mass and wall thickness of the left ventricle, most commonly resulting from chronic pressure overload such as systemic hypertension or aortic stenosis. It is identified by echocardiographic or imaging criteria demonstrating an elevated left ventricular mass index relative to normative reference values.
Right ventricular hypertrophy - Right ventricular hypertrophy is the pathological increase in myocardial mass and wall thickness of the right ventricle, most often secondary to chronic pressure overload (e.g., pulmonary hypertension) or volume overload from congenital or valvular lesions. It is distinguished from left ventricular hypertrophy by involving the right-sided chamber and the specific hemodynamic stresses that drive its development.
Ventricular Noncompaction - Ventricular noncompaction is a cardiomyopathic disorder characterized by arrest of normal myocardial compaction during embryogenesis, producing a bilayered ventricular wall with a thin compacted epicardial layer and a thick non‑compacted endocardial layer containing prominent trabeculations and deep intertrabecular recesses that communicate with the ventricular cavity. It is distinguished from other cardiomyopathies by the presence of these deep recesses and a ratio of non‑compacted to compacted myocardium exceeding established imaging thresholds.
Left Ventricular Noncompaction - Left ventricular noncompaction is a congenital cardiomyopathy characterized by a distinctive two‑layered myocardial architecture in which a thin, compacted outer layer overlies a markedly thickened, trabeculated inner layer containing deep intertrabecular recesses that communicate with the ventricular cavity. The condition results from incomplete embryonic myocardial compaction and is differentiated from other cardiomyopathies by the elevated ratio of noncompacted to compacted myocardium on cardiac imaging.
Right Ventricular Noncompaction - Right ventricular noncompaction is a congenital cardiomyopathy characterized by incomplete embryologic compaction of the right ventricular myocardium, resulting in a spongiform appearance with excessive trabeculations and deep intertrabecular recesses confined to the right ventricle; it predisposes to systolic dysfunction, ventricular arrhythmias, and thromboembolic events. It is distinct from left ventricular noncompaction and from arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, which involve different anatomic patterns and pathophysiologic mechanisms.
Ventricular Functional Disorder - Ventricular functional disorder denotes a clinical condition characterized by abnormal systolic or diastolic performance of one or both ventricles that cannot be explained by intrinsic myocardial disease, valvular pathology, or congenital structural anomalies. It is identified by reduced ejection fraction, impaired ventricular compliance, or abnormal pressure‑volume relationships on imaging or invasive hemodynamic assessment.
Ventricular Dysfunction - Ventricular dysfunction refers to the impaired ability of one or both cardiac ventricles to generate adequate pressure (systolic dysfunction) or to relax and fill properly (diastolic dysfunction), resulting in reduced ventricular performance. It may arise from primary myocardial disease, pressure or volume overload, or secondary systemic conditions, and is distinguished from the clinical syndrome of heart failure, which encompasses the symptomatic consequences of such functional impairment.
Left Ventricular Dysfunction - Left ventricular dysfunction denotes an abnormal reduction in the contractile or relaxation performance of the left ventricle, resulting in impaired generation of systolic pressure, diastolic filling, or both, and consequently decreased effective cardiac output. It is distinguished from structural left ventricular disease by focusing on functional impairment rather than solely anatomical abnormalities.
Right Ventricular Dysfunction - Right ventricular dysfunction denotes impaired systolic and/or diastolic performance of the right ventricle resulting in reduced forward pulmonary blood flow, elevated right‑sided filling pressures, and systemic venous congestion. It is distinguished from left ventricular dysfunction by its primary effect on right‑ventricular contractility, preload handling, and pulmonary circulation.
Ventricular Failure - Ventricular failure is a clinical syndrome in which one or both cardiac ventricles exhibit impaired contractile performance, resulting in an inability to generate sufficient stroke volume to meet systemic or pulmonary circulatory demands. It is distinguished from generic heart failure by specifying the anatomic chamber(s) responsible for the pump dysfunction and by implicating consequent elevations in ventricular end‑diastolic pressure and volume overload. The condition may be classified as left, right, or biventricular failure depending on the affected ventricle(s).
Left Ventricular Failure - Left ventricular failure is a clinical syndrome in which the left ventricle is unable to provide adequate cardiac output to satisfy systemic metabolic requirements, resulting in elevated left‑atrial pressure, pulmonary venous congestion, and reduced systemic perfusion. It may manifest as systolic dysfunction (reduced ejection fraction) or diastolic dysfunction (preserved ejection fraction) and is distinguished from right‑ventricular failure by predominance of left‑sided hemodynamic abnormalities.
Right Ventricular Failure - Right ventricular failure is a clinical syndrome in which the right ventricle is unable to generate sufficient pressure or flow to maintain effective pulmonary circulation, resulting in systemic venous congestion, hepatic and peripheral edema, and reduced cardiac output. It is distinguished from left ventricular failure by predominance of right‑sided signs and from cor pulmonale by its etiologic heterogeneity, encompassing primary myocardial disease, pressure overload, or volume overload of the right ventricle.
Valvular Heart Diseases - Valvular heart diseases are a group of structural or functional disorders of the cardiac valves that result in abnormal hemodynamic flow through the heart, manifesting as stenosis, regurgitation, or a combination of both, and are distinct from congenital valve anomalies or acquired valve infections.
Aortic Valve Disease - Aortic valve disease comprises any structural or functional abnormality of the aortic valve that disrupts normal left‑ventricular outflow, resulting in altered transvalvular hemodynamics. It includes entities such as aortic stenosis (obstructive narrowing) and aortic regurgitation (inadequate leaflet coaptation with diastolic backflow), which may be congenital or acquired.
Aortic valve disease - Aortic valve disease is a pathological condition of the aortic valve marked by structural or functional abnormalities that produce hemodynamic obstruction (aortic stenosis), regurgitation (aortic insufficiency), or a combination of both. It includes degenerative, rheumatic, congenital, and infective etiologies and is distinct from isolated aortic root pathology or ventricular outflow tract obstruction.
Aortic stenosis - Aortic stenosis is a valvular heart disease characterized by progressive narrowing of the aortic valve orifice, which impedes left ventricular outflow, generates a pressure gradient across the valve, and leads to left ventricular pressure overload and subsequent hypertrophy.
Low-gradient aortic stenosis - Low‑gradient aortic stenosis is a subtype of severe aortic valve narrowing in which the mean transvalvular gradient is ≤ 40 mm Hg despite an aortic valve area ≤ 1.0 cm², occurring either with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (classical low‑flow) or with preserved ejection fraction but low stroke volume (paradoxical low‑flow).
Low-flow low-gradient aortic stenosis - Low‑flow low‑gradient aortic stenosis is a severe form of aortic valve narrowing in which the aortic valve area is ≤1.0 cm² but the mean transvalvular gradient remains <40 mmHg due to a reduced stroke‑volume index (<35 mL/m²), occurring with either depressed left‑ventricular ejection fraction or, paradoxically, with preserved ejection fraction and concentric remodeling. It is distinguished from classic high‑gradient severe aortic stenosis by the reliance on flow‑dependent gradients rather than pressure gradients alone, and from moderate stenosis by the persistently severe valve area despite low flow.
Aortic regurgitation - Aortic regurgitation is a valvular disorder characterized by incomplete closure of the aortic valve during diastole, resulting in retrograde flow of blood from the aorta into the left ventricular cavity. It is distinguished from aortic stenosis, which involves obstructed forward flow, and from aortic insufficiency, which is synonymous terminology. The condition may lead to left ventricular volume overload, eccentric hypertrophy, and progressive heart failure if severe.
Mitral Valve Disease - Mitral valve disease encompasses any structural or functional abnormality of the mitral valve apparatus that impairs normal unidirectional blood flow between the left atrium and left ventricle, including primary leaflet pathology, annular dilation, or subvalvular apparatus dysfunction. It may manifest as regurgitation, stenosis, or mixed lesions and is distinguished from isolated mitral regurgitation or stenosis, which describe specific hemodynamic consequences of the broader valvular pathology.
Mitral regurgitation - Mitral regurgitation is a valvular heart disease in which incompetent closure of the mitral valve allows systolic backflow of blood from the left ventricle into the left atrium, resulting from primary leaflet, chordal, or papillary muscle pathology or secondary ventricular dilation that prevents proper leaflet coaptation. It is distinguished from mitral stenosis, which obstructs forward flow, and from mitral valve prolapse, which may be an anatomic substrate that can lead to regurgitation when severe.
Mitral stenosis - Mitral stenosis is a valvular heart disease characterized by a fixed reduction of the mitral valve orifice that impedes diastolic blood flow from the left atrium to the left ventricle, most commonly resulting from rheumatic fibrosis. The narrowed valve produces elevated left‑atrial pressure, pulmonary venous hypertension, and may lead to atrial dilatation and arrhythmias. It is distinct from mitral regurgitation, which involves incompetent closure and backward flow during systole.
Mitral valve prolapse - Mitral valve prolapse is a valvular disorder in which the mitral leaflets and chordae tendineae abnormally billow into the left atrium during systole, often resulting in midsystolic click and varying degrees of mitral regurgitation. It is distinguished from functional mitral insufficiency by the primary structural abnormality of the valve apparatus rather than secondary ventricular dilation. This condition predisposes to arrhythmias, endothelial dysfunction, and, in some cases, infective endocarditis.
Tricuspid valve disease - Tricuspid valve disease denotes any structural or functional abnormality of the tricuspid valve that impairs its competence (producing regurgitation) or restricts its orifice (producing stenosis), thereby disrupting right‑atrial and right‑ventricular hemodynamics. It is distinguished from diseases of the mitral, aortic, or pulmonary valves, which affect left‑sided or semilunar circulation.
Tricuspid regurgitation - Tricuspid regurgitation is a valvular insufficiency in which the tricuspid valve fails to coapt during systole, allowing retrograde flow of blood from the right ventricle into the right atrium. It is distinguished from tricuspid stenosis, which involves obstruction to forward flow, and may be primary (leaflet pathology) or secondary to right‑ventricular dilatation.
Tricuspid stenosis - Tricuspid stenosis is a valvular heart disease characterized by a fixed narrowing of the tricuspid orifice that obstructs right‑atrial inflow into the right ventricle, leading to elevated right‑atrial pressures and systemic venous congestion. It is distinguished from tricuspid regurgitation, which involves retrograde flow, and from pulmonary valve stenosis, which affects the outflow tract to the pulmonary artery.
Pulmonary Valve Disease - Pulmonary valve disease encompasses structural or functional abnormalities of the semilunar valve that governs blood flow from the right ventricle to the pulmonary artery, most commonly manifesting as stenosis (obstructive narrowing) or regurgitation (incompetent closure). These lesions impair right ventricular afterload and forward flow, distinguishing them from right‑ventricular outflow tract obstruction caused by non‑valvular congenital or acquired lesions.
Pulmonary stenosis - Pulmonary stenosis is a valvular heart disease characterized by a narrowing of the pulmonary valve or the right ventricular outflow tract, which obstructs blood flow from the right ventricle into the pulmonary artery and elevates right‑ventricular pressure. It is distinguished from pulmonary regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension by the presence of a fixed anatomic obstruction rather than valve insufficiency or elevated pulmonary vascular resistance.
Pulmonary regurgitation - Pulmonary regurgitation is a valvular disorder characterized by incomplete closure of the pulmonary valve during diastole, allowing retrograde flow of blood from the pulmonary artery into the right ventricle. This hemodynamic abnormality leads to right‑ventricular volume overload and may be distinguished from pulmonary stenosis, which involves forward‑flow obstruction, and from aortic regurgitation, which affects the systemic circulation.
Congenital Heart Disease - Congenital heart disease refers to a spectrum of structural malformations of the heart or great vessels that arise during embryonic development and are present at birth, resulting in abnormal cardiac anatomy, altered hemodynamics, and potential impairment of cardiac function. Unlike acquired heart disease, these anomalies are not the consequence of postnatal pathophysiological processes but reflect developmental defects that may require surgical, catheter‑based, or medical management.
Septal defect - Septal defect is a structural cardiac abnormality characterized by an incomplete or perforated atrial or ventricular septum that creates an abnormal communication between the left and right heart chambers, permitting intracardiac blood shunting. It is classified according to the septal location (atrial, ventricular, or atrioventricular) and differs from specific atrial or ventricular septal defects, which refer solely to defects of a single septum.
Cardiac Shunt - An abnormal communication that permits blood to flow directly between cardiac chambers or great vessels, bypassing the normal sequential circulation; the flow may be left‑to‑right, right‑to‑left, or bidirectional depending on pressure gradients and anatomic defects. This hemodynamic disturbance often results from congenital malformations (e.g., septal defects, patent ductus arteriosus) and can lead to volume overload, hypoxemia, or pulmonary hypertension. It is a pathophysiologic condition rather than a distinct disease entity.
Atrial septal defect - A congenital malformation of the interatrial septum that creates a communication between the left and right atria, permitting blood flow—typically left‑to‑right—from the higher‑pressure left side to the lower‑pressure right side. This intracardiac shunt can lead to right‑atrial and right‑ventricular volume overload, pulmonary overcirculation, and, if uncorrected, progressive cardiopulmonary complications.
Ventricular septal defect - A ventricular septal defect is a congenital cardiac malformation characterized by an abnormal opening in the interventricular septum that permits left‑to‑right shunting of blood between the ventricles. The defect leads to volume overload of the right ventricle and pulmonary circulation, distinguishing it from defects of the atrial septum or acquired ventricular wall perforations.
Patent foramen ovale - Patent foramen ovale is a congenital interatrial communication that persists after birth due to incomplete fusion of the septum primum and septum secundum, allowing a potential right‑to‑left shunt across the atrial septum. It represents an anatomic variant rather than an acquired disease, though it can serve as a conduit for embolic events.
Intracardiac shunt - An intracardiac shunt is an abnormal communication between two cardiac chambers that permits blood to flow directly from one chamber to another, bypassing the normal circulatory route; it may be congenital (e.g., atrial or ventricular septal defect) or acquired (e.g., trauma or surgical complication). This aberrant flow can produce volume overload and pressure changes in the receiving chamber, distinguishing it from extracardiac shunts that involve vascular connections outside the heart.
Right-to-left shunt - A right‑to‑left shunt is an abnormal intracardiac or extracardiac conduit that allows deoxygenated blood to bypass the pulmonary circulation and flow directly from the right side of the heart into the left side or systemic arterial tree, resulting in arterial hypoxemia. It differs from a left‑to‑right shunt, which diverts oxygenated blood into the right‑heart circulation. This hemodynamic abnormality is a pathophysiologic condition rather than a disease entity.
Congenital Heart Defect - A congenital heart defect is a structural abnormality of the heart or adjacent great vessels that is present at birth, arising from aberrant cardiac morphogenesis during embryonic development. The defect may involve septa, valves, chambers, or outflow tracts and can impair hemodynamic function, leading to cyanosis, heart failure, or other complications. It is classified as a disease entity within the spectrum of congenital cardiovascular malformations.
Patent ductus arteriosus - Patent ductus arteriosus is a congenital cardiovascular malformation in which the fetal connection between the descending aorta and the pulmonary artery (the ductus arteriosus) fails to close after birth, resulting in a persistent left‑to‑right shunt that can lead to pulmonary overcirculation, volume overload of the left heart, and, if untreated, pulmonary hypertension.
Outflow Tract Obstruction - Outflow tract obstruction is a pathological narrowing or functional blockage of the ventricular outflow tract that impedes ejection of blood from the left or right ventricle into the corresponding great artery. It may be congenital (e.g., subaortic membrane, pulmonary valve stenosis) or acquired and is classified as a structural cardiac disorder.
Subaortic stenosis - Subaortic stenosis is a congenital or acquired obstructive lesion situated below the aortic valve that narrows the left ventricular outflow tract, leading to increased left ventricular pressure and potential hypertrophy. It is distinguished from valvular aortic stenosis by its subvalvular location and from coarctation by the absence of a discrete aortic arch narrowing. This condition is classified as a structural cardiovascular disease.
Supravalvar aortic stenosis - Supravalvar aortic stenosis is a narrowing of the ascending aorta immediately above the aortic valve that impedes left ventricular outflow. It is characterized by reduced aortic compliance and may occur as an isolated lesion or in association with syndromic conditions such as Williams syndrome, distinguishing it from valvular aortic stenosis, which involves obstruction at the level of the valve leaflets.
Pulmonary artery stenosis - A localized narrowing of the pulmonary artery lumen that obstructs blood flow from the right ventricle into the pulmonary circulation, resulting in increased right ventricular afterload and potential right‑sided pressure overload. It may be congenital or acquired and differs from pulmonary hypertension, which denotes elevated pressure without an anatomic obstruction.
Pulmonary atresia - Pulmonary atresia is a congenital cardiac malformation characterized by complete absence or closure of the pulmonary valve orifice, resulting in obstruction of right ventricular outflow and lack of direct blood flow from the right ventricle to the pulmonary arteries. It is distinct from pulmonary stenosis, which involves a narrowed but patent valve, and often requires alternative sources of pulmonary blood flow such as a patent ductus arteriosus or surgical shunt.
Great Vessel Structural Anomaly - A great vessel structural anomaly is a congenital malformation of one or more of the principal vessels that connect the heart to the systemic or pulmonary circulation—typically the aorta, pulmonary artery, superior vena cava, or inferior vena cava—characterized by abnormal origin, course, branching pattern, or connectivity. It differs from intracardiac defects and valvular abnormalities by involving the extracardiac arterial or venous trunks rather than the cardiac chambers or valves. This anomaly predisposes to altered hemodynamics and may be associated with other congenital heart lesions.
Coarctation of the aorta - A congenital narrowing of the aortic lumen, most commonly located distal to the ligamentum arteriosum, that creates a fixed obstruction to left‑ventricular outflow, resulting in upper‑body hypertension, lower‑body hypoperfusion, and collateral vessel formation. This structural cardiovascular malformation is classified as a congenital heart disease.
Complex Congenital Heart Disease - Complex congenital heart disease denotes a spectrum of structural cardiac malformations present at birth that involve multiple defects or lesions affecting several cardiac chambers, great vessels, or physiologic connections, and typically necessitate early surgical or catheter‑based intervention; it is distinguished from simple congenital heart disease by the presence of combined or intricate anomalies that confer higher morbidity and mortality.
Tetralogy of Fallot - Tetralogy of Fallot is a cyanotic congenital heart disease defined by the coexistence of (1) a ventricular septal defect, (2) an overriding aortic root that receives blood from both ventricles, (3) right ventricular outflow tract obstruction typically due to pulmonary valve stenosis, and (4) secondary right ventricular hypertrophy. This specific quartet of malformations distinguishes it from other cyanotic lesions such as transposition of the great arteries or truncus arteriosus.
Transposition of the great arteries - Transposition of the great arteries is a congenital cardiac malformation in which the aorta originates from the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery from the left ventricle, producing parallel systemic and pulmonary circulations that normally result in severe cyanosis unless intercirculatory mixing occurs.
Truncus arteriosus - Truncus arteriosus is a rare congenital cardiac malformation in which a single arterial trunk arises from the ventricular mass, providing systemic, pulmonary, and coronary blood flow through a common semilunar valve, often accompanied by a ventricular septal defect. It is distinguished from other conotruncal abnormalities, such as double‑outlet right ventricle or pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect, by the presence of one unified arterial outflow rather than separate aortic and pulmonary vessels.
Double outlet right ventricle - Double outlet right ventricle is a congenital cardiac malformation in which both the aorta and the pulmonary artery arise predominantly or exclusively from the right ventricle, typically associated with a ventricular septal defect that directs blood flow between the systemic and pulmonary circuits. This configuration distinguishes it from transposition of the great arteries (where the great arteries arise from opposite ventricles) and from tetralogy of Fallot, which features overriding aorta and right ventricular outflow obstruction.
Valvular Malformation - A valvular malformation is a congenital structural anomaly of one or more cardiac valves in which the leaflets, chordae tendineae, or supporting annulus are abnormally formed, resulting in altered valve architecture that predisposes to functional impairment such as stenosis or regurgitation. It differs from acquired valvular disease, which arises secondary to processes like infection, degeneration, or rheumatic injury.
Ebstein anomaly - Ebstein anomaly is a congenital malformation of the tricuspid valve in which the septal and posterior leaflets are displaced apically, causing atrialization of a portion of the right ventricle and resulting in functional tricuspid regurgitation. This rare right‑sided heart disease may be accompanied by arrhythmias, cyanosis, and right‑ventricular dysfunction. It is distinguished from isolated tricuspid regurgitation by its embryologic origin and the characteristic displacement of valve leaflets.
Non-Valvular Structural Malformation - A non‑valvular structural malformation is an anatomic alteration of the heart’s chambers, septa, great vessels, or supporting structures that occurs without involvement of the atrioventricular or semilunar valves. It may be congenital or acquired, can modify intracardiac flow dynamics, and serves as a substrate for related cardiovascular complications.
Cor triatriatum - Cor triatriatum is a rare congenital cardiac malformation in which a fibromuscular membrane partitions an atrium—most commonly the left—into a proximal chamber receiving pulmonary venous return and a distal chamber communicating with the mitral valve, creating functional obstruction of atrial flow. It is a structural heart defect distinct from atrial septal defects and anomalous pulmonary venous connections.
Metric - A metric is a quantified parameter derived from clinical, imaging, laboratory, or physiologic data that objectively characterizes cardiovascular structure, function, or disease status. It serves as a numerical index for assessing, monitoring, or comparing cardiac performance or progression, distinct from a specific biomarker or a diagnostic test result.
Risk Estimation - Risk estimation is the quantitative assessment of an individual’s probability of experiencing a cardiovascular event (e.g., myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiac death) within a defined time horizon, calculated from validated prediction models that integrate demographic, clinical, and laboratory variables. Unlike identification of risk factors, it yields an individualized probability rather than a simple association.
Prediction Metric - A prediction metric is a quantitatively derived score that combines patient-specific clinical variables, laboratory results, imaging findings, or other measurable factors to estimate the probability of a cardiovascular event, disease progression, or therapeutic response. It is employed in risk stratification, clinical decision support, and outcome modeling, distinguishing it from direct measurements or diagnostic tests by representing a statistical estimate rather than a physiological observation.
10-year ASCVD risk - A 10‑year ASCVD risk estimate quantifies the probability that an individual will experience a first atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease event—defined as non‑fatal myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease death, or fatal/non‑fatal ischemic stroke—within the next ten years, based on demographic, clinical, and laboratory variables incorporated into validated risk equations (e.g., the Pooled Cohort Equations). It is a predictive risk assessment tool rather than a disease entity.
20-year ASCVD risk - The 20‑year ASCVD risk is a quantitative estimate of the probability that an individual without prior atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease will experience a first fatal or non‑fatal ASCVD event (including myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, or coronary death) within the subsequent 20 years, calculated using multivariable risk equations that incorporate demographic and clinical factors such as age, sex, race, blood pressure, lipid levels, smoking status, and diabetes mellitus.
ASCVD risk - ASCVD risk is an estimated probability, expressed as a percentage, that an individual will experience a first atherosclerotic cardiovascular event—such as myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, or fatal coronary heart disease—within a defined time horizon, most commonly ten years. The estimate is derived from a multivariate algorithm incorporating demographic factors, clinical history, and laboratory measurements.
Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk - Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk denotes the estimated probability that an individual will experience a clinical event attributable to atherosclerotic plaque—such as myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, or peripheral arterial disease—within a specified time horizon. The risk is quantified using validated prediction models that integrate demographic variables, traditional risk factors (e.g., hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, smoking), and, when available, biomarkers or imaging findings.
Risk estimate - A risk estimate is a quantitative assessment of the probability that an individual will develop or experience a cardiovascular event within a defined time frame, calculated using validated predictive models that incorporate demographic data, clinical variables, and biomarkers. It differs from a risk factor in that it expresses the overall predicted likelihood rather than identifying a single causative element.
High cardiovascular risk - A state characterized by an elevated probability of experiencing future atherosclerotic cardiovascular events—such as myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death—based on the cumulative presence, severity, and interaction of established risk determinants (e.g., age, hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, smoking, family history, and relevant biomarkers). It differs from isolated risk factors by representing a quantified overall risk level that guides preventive and therapeutic decision‑making.
High-risk ASCVD - High-risk ASCVD designates individuals with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease who, because of clinical characteristics such as recent acute events, extensive multivessel involvement, diabetes mellitus, or the presence of multiple major risk factors, have a markedly elevated likelihood of subsequent cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. It functions as a risk‑stratification category guiding intensified preventive and therapeutic interventions.
High-risk cardiovascular profile - A high‑risk cardiovascular profile denotes a composite assessment in which an individual exhibits multiple adverse cardiovascular risk factors, subclinical disease markers, or abnormal clinical measurements that together confer a markedly elevated probability of major cardiovascular events (e.g., myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death) compared with the general population. It differs from isolated risk factors by integrating the cumulative impact of variables such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, smoking, family history, elevated inflammatory biomarkers, and evidence of organ damage.
Cardiovascular risk assessment - Cardiovascular risk assessment is the systematic evaluation of an individual’s probability of developing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events, integrating demographic factors, clinical history, laboratory biomarkers, and imaging findings to generate a quantitative or categorical risk estimate that guides preventive and therapeutic decision‑making.
Cardiovascular risk estimation - A quantitative assessment that combines patient‐specific variables (such as age, sex, blood pressure, lipid levels, smoking status, diabetes, and other clinical factors) to predict the probability of future cardiovascular events (e.g., myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death) over a defined time horizon. This estimation is used to guide preventive strategies and therapeutic decision‑making in cardiovascular care.
Cardiovascular risk prediction - Cardiovascular risk prediction is a prognostic assessment that estimates an individual’s probability of developing future atherosclerotic cardiovascular events (such as myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death) over a defined time horizon by integrating demographic, clinical, laboratory, and imaging variables into validated statistical or machine‑learning models. This predictive process is utilized to stratify patients, guide preventive interventions, and inform shared decision‑making in cardiovascular care.
Cardiovascular risk scores - Cardiovascular risk scores are composite quantitative indices calculated from demographic, behavioral, and clinical variables (such as age, sex, blood pressure, lipid levels, smoking status, and diabetes) to estimate an individual’s probability of experiencing a cardiovascular event (e.g., myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death) over a defined time horizon. They serve as prognostic tools for risk stratification and guide preventive management decisions.
Cardiovascular risk stratification - Cardiovascular risk stratification is the systematic evaluation of an individual’s probability of developing atherosclerotic events or heart failure based on clinical variables, laboratory biomarkers, imaging findings, and comorbid conditions, yielding a categorical or quantitative risk level that guides preventive and therapeutic decision‑making.
MACE score - The MACE score is a quantitative risk assessment tool that estimates an individual’s likelihood of experiencing a major adverse cardiovascular event—typically defined as cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or urgent revascularization—by integrating demographic, clinical, and laboratory variables. It is employed in cardiovascular research and clinical decision‑support systems to stratify patients according to short‑ and long‑term cardiovascular risk.
Gender-specific risk models - Gender-specific risk models are statistical prediction tools that estimate an individual’s likelihood of developing cardiovascular disease by incorporating variables and coefficients derived separately for males and females, thereby reflecting sex‑related differences in prevalence, pathophysiology, and outcomes. These models are employed in clinical decision support to tailor prevention and treatment strategies based on gender‑adjusted risk estimates.
Risk Factor - In cardiovascular medicine, a risk factor is a modifiable or non‑modifiable characteristic—such as elevated blood pressure, dyslipidaemia, diabetes mellitus, tobacco use, or genetic predisposition—that statistically increases an individual’s likelihood of developing coronary artery disease or other cardiac pathology. It differs from a disease, which denotes established pathology, and from biomarkers or diagnostic tests, which identify existing disease rather than predispose to it.
Behavioral Risk Factor - A behavioral risk factor is a modifiable pattern of conduct—such as tobacco use, excessive alcohol consumption, physical inactivity, or an unhealthy diet—that elevates an individual’s probability of developing or progressing cardiovascular disease.
Tobacco Use - Tobacco use denotes the habitual consumption of tobacco products—including smoked (cigarettes, cigars, pipes) and smokeless forms—resulting in systemic exposure to nicotine and combustion by‑products that promote endothelial dysfunction, atherogenesis, and heightened risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.
Alcohol consumption - Alcohol consumption denotes the ingestion of ethanol‑containing beverages in varying quantities and frequencies. In cardiovascular medicine it is considered a modifiable exposure that influences the risk of hypertension, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy, and atherosclerotic disease in a dose‑dependent manner.
Substance use - Substance use denotes the consumption of psychoactive or non‑psychoactive agents—including alcohol, tobacco, illicit drugs, and prescribed medications—by an individual in occasional, regular, or chronic patterns. In cardiovascular medicine, it is regarded as a modifiable risk factor that can initiate or exacerbate coronary artery disease, arrhythmias, and heart failure, and is distinct from substance abuse, which implies a maladaptive pattern of use with functional impairment.
Electronic Cigarette Use - Electronic cigarette use denotes the inhalation of aerosol produced by battery‑operated vaping devices containing nicotine, flavoring agents, and other chemical constituents, representing exposure to non‑combustible tobacco products. In the cardiovascular context it functions as a behavioral risk factor linked to endothelial dysfunction, increased arterial stiffness, and elevated risk of coronary artery disease. It is distinct from conventional cigarette smoking by the lack of combustion byproducts, yet still delivers nicotine and potentially harmful volatile compounds.
Lifestyle Risk Factors - Modifiable behaviors and exposures—such as tobacco use, unhealthy dietary patterns, physical inactivity, and excess alcohol consumption—that increase an individual’s probability of developing cardiovascular disease. These factors differ from non‑modifiable determinants (e.g., genetic predisposition) and are targets for preventive interventions.
Physical Activity - Physical activity denotes any bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles that results in energy expenditure above resting metabolic rate, including leisure, occupational, and transport-related activities; in cardiovascular medicine it is a modifiable behavioral factor that influences cardiac function, endothelial health, and the incidence of cardiovascular disease.
Diet - Diet is the habitual pattern of food and beverage consumption, defined by nutrient composition, caloric content, and eating behaviors, that modulates cardiovascular risk through effects on lipid metabolism, blood pressure, glycemic control, and systemic inflammation; it is a modifiable lifestyle factor targeted in primary and secondary prevention of heart disease.
High-fat diet - A high‑fat diet is a dietary pattern marked by consumption of total fat exceeding recommended levels, particularly saturated and trans fatty acids, which elevates plasma lipids and promotes atherogenic processes, constituting a modifiable risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.
Whole-grain diet - A whole‑grain diet is a dietary pattern in which the majority of grain foods are consumed in their minimally refined form, retaining the bran, germ, and endosperm, thereby providing dietary fiber, vitamins, minerals, and phytochemicals. This pattern is associated with favorable lipid profiles, improved endothelial function, and a reduced incidence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, distinguishing it from diets centered on refined grains.
Healthy diet - A healthy diet in the cardiovascular context is a dietary pattern that emphasizes consumption of nutrient-dense foods such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, lean protein sources, and unsaturated fats while limiting saturated fat, trans fat, added sugars, sodium, and processed meats; this pattern provides adequate micronutrients and fiber to support optimal lipid profiles, blood pressure regulation, glycemic control, and endothelial function, thereby reducing the incidence and progression of atherosclerotic heart disease.
Unhealthy diet - A dietary pattern characterized by excessive intake of saturated fats, trans fatty acids, cholesterol, refined sugars, and sodium, coupled with insufficient consumption of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and omega‑3 fatty acids, that promotes dyslipidemia, hypertension, insulin resistance, and systemic inflammation, thereby increasing the risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.
Weight management - Weight management is a multi‑component therapeutic strategy that employs dietary modification, physical activity, behavioral counseling, and, when appropriate, pharmacologic or surgical interventions to achieve and sustain a body weight that aligns with evidence‑based cardiovascular risk reduction targets. It is distinct from isolated weight‑loss attempts by emphasizing long‑term maintenance of optimal weight and integration with overall cardiovascular risk‑factor control.
Social Determinants of Health - Social determinants of health are the socioeconomic, environmental, and cultural conditions—such as income, education, housing stability, neighborhood infrastructure, and access to health‑promoting resources—that influence the incidence, progression, and outcomes of cardiovascular disease across populations.
Socioeconomic status - Socioeconomic status is a composite measure of an individual’s or population’s relative economic and social position, typically quantified by income, educational attainment, and occupational class, which influences access to healthcare resources, exposure to cardiovascular risk factors, and disease outcomes; it is considered a non‑biological determinant of heart disease risk distinct from clinical biomarkers, lifestyle behaviors, and genetic predisposition.
Food access - Food access denotes the availability, affordability, and physical proximity of nutritionally adequate foods within an individual’s environment, thereby shaping dietary intake patterns. As a modifiable social determinant, limited food access constitutes a risk factor that contributes to the development and progression of cardiovascular disease.
Food insecurity - Food insecurity denotes a lack of reliable access to sufficient, safe, and nutritionally adequate foods, resulting in compromised dietary quality and irregular eating patterns. In the cardiovascular domain, it functions as a socioeconomic risk factor that is associated with higher incidence, accelerated progression, and poorer outcomes of heart disease.
Food security - Food security denotes a condition in which individuals have reliable access to adequate, safe, and nutritionally appropriate food that satisfies dietary requirements and preferences, thereby supporting overall health and reducing exposure to cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, and obesity.
Environmental Determinants of Health - Non‑individual factors in the physical, chemical, and built environment—such as air pollution, ambient temperature, noise, green‑space availability, and socioeconomic neighborhood characteristics—that modify the incidence, progression, or prognosis of cardiovascular diseases. These determinants act as upstream exposures influencing biological pathways (e.g., inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, autonomic imbalance) and thus constitute modifiable risk contributors to heart disease.
Air pollution exposure - Inhalation of ambient airborne contaminants—such as particulate matter (PM₂.₅, PM₁₀), nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, ozone, and carbon monoxide—at concentrations above established environmental thresholds. This exposure initiates systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, and endothelial dysfunction, thereby constituting a modifiable risk factor for the development and progression of cardiovascular disease.
Demographic Risk Factor - A demographic risk factor is a non‑modifiable population characteristic—such as age, sex, race/ethnicity, or socioeconomic status—whose presence is statistically associated with a higher incidence or prevalence of cardiovascular disease.
Age - Age is the patient’s chronological time elapsed since birth, measured in years, and functions as a non‑modifiable demographic variable that influences the incidence, progression, and prognosis of cardiovascular diseases. Advanced age is independently associated with higher prevalence of atherosclerosis, hypertension, heart failure, and related adverse outcomes, distinguishing it from modifiable risk factors.
Sex - Sex denotes the biologic classification of an individual as male or female based on chromosomal complement, gonadal development, and endogenous hormone profiles, which independently modify cardiovascular risk, disease phenotypes, and therapeutic response.
Male - Male denotes an individual biologically assigned the male sex, characterized by XY chromosomes and typical male reproductive anatomy; in cardiovascular contexts, male sex functions as a demographic factor associated with distinct epidemiological patterns and risk profiles for heart disease.
Female - Female denotes the biological sex characterized by the presence of two X chromosomes, functional ovaries, and typical female reproductive anatomy; in cardiovascular medicine it is a demographic attribute that influences disease epidemiology, risk factor prevalence, clinical presentation, and treatment outcomes.
Gender - Gender denotes the socially constructed roles, identities, behaviors, and expressions with which individuals self‑identify (e.g., male, female, transgender, non‑binary), and is distinct from biological sex; in cardiovascular contexts it is treated as a demographic factor influencing disease prevalence, presentation, and outcomes.
Man - An adult human male, biologically characterized by a 46,XY karyotype and typically possessing male secondary sexual characteristics, who is a demographic population considered in cardiovascular epidemiology and risk‑factor analyses.
Woman - Woman: an adult human of the female sex, typically possessing a 46,XX karyotype and female reproductive anatomy, who constitutes a demographic subgroup in cardiovascular epidemiology. Sex‐specific biological and hormonal differences associated with women influence the prevalence, clinical presentation, and outcomes of heart disease, making sex a non‑modifiable risk factor in risk stratification.
Non-binary - Non‑binary refers to a gender identity in which an individual does not exclusively identify as male or female, and is used as a demographic variable in cardiovascular research to capture gender‑diverse patients whose physiological and psychosocial risk profiles may differ from those of cisgender men and women.
Ethnicity - Ethnicity denotes a socially defined population group sharing common cultural, linguistic, ancestral, or historical characteristics, employed in cardiovascular research and clinical risk assessment to account for population-level differences in disease prevalence, risk‑factor distribution, and therapeutic response.
Race - Race is a socially constructed demographic classification employed in cardiovascular epidemiology to capture population‑level differences in genetic ancestry, socioeconomic exposures, and health outcomes; it is used as a covariate in risk‑assessment models for heart disease but does not represent a pathophysiologic entity.
Biological Risk Factors - Biological risk factors are endogenous physiological or molecular characteristics that increase an individual’s probability of developing cardiovascular disease, such as dyslipidemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and elevated inflammatory markers. These intrinsic host factors are quantified by clinical or laboratory assessment and are distinguished from behavioral or environmental contributors.
Early menopause - Early menopause is the permanent cessation of ovarian function occurring before age 45, confirmed by ≥12 months of amenorrhea and elevated follicle‑stimulating hormone levels consistent with the menopausal range. It constitutes a risk factor for cardiovascular disease because the premature loss of endogenous estrogen accelerates adverse lipid profiles, endothelial dysfunction, and atherogenesis.
Early age of disease onset - The early age of disease onset denotes the manifestation of a cardiovascular disorder at a chronological age substantially younger than the median age observed in the general population for that condition, reflecting an atypically premature presentation. This attribute is used to identify a subset of patients who may have distinct genetic, environmental, or lifestyle contributors and often correlates with a more aggressive disease course. It is distinguished from early-stage disease, which refers to severity rather than the patient's age at initial diagnosis.
Genetic predisposition - An inherited genetic predisposition refers to the presence of heritable DNA variants that increase an individual’s susceptibility to developing cardiovascular diseases, such as coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathies, or arrhythmias, compared with the general population. These variants confer heightened risk independent of environmental exposures, although they may interact with modifiable factors to modulate disease onset and severity.
Family history of cardiovascular disease - A documented occurrence of cardiovascular disease (including coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral arterial disease, or congenital heart disease) in one or more first-degree relatives, which is used as a hereditary risk factor to assess an individual’s probability of developing cardiovascular pathology.
Glycemic Disorder - A glycemic disorder is a metabolic condition marked by persistent dysregulation of plasma glucose levels, including chronic hyperglycemia (as seen in diabetes mellitus) and recurrent hypoglycemia, that contributes to endothelial dysfunction, atherogenesis, and other pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying cardiovascular disease. It is recognized as a modifiable risk factor for coronary artery disease, heart failure, and cerebrovascular events.
Diabetes Mellitus - Diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disorder marked by persistent hyperglycemia due to absolute or relative insulin deficiency, impaired insulin secretion, and/or insulin resistance. The resulting metabolic derangements accelerate macrovascular disease, notably atherosclerosis, and increase the risk of coronary artery disease, heart failure, and peripheral arterial disease.
Type 1 diabetes mellitus - Type 1 diabetes mellitus is an autoimmune disorder in which immune‑mediated destruction of pancreatic β‑cells leads to absolute insulin deficiency and chronic hyperglycemia; this metabolic derangement accelerates endothelial dysfunction and atherogenesis, making it a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus - Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by insulin resistance combined with progressive β‑cell dysfunction, resulting in hyperglycemia that persists despite lifestyle measures and may require oral hypoglycemic agents or insulin therapy. It is a major modifiable risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, contributing to endothelial dysfunction, dyslipidemia, and accelerated vascular complications.
Glycemic control - Glycemic control denotes the therapeutic regulation of blood glucose concentrations to maintain values within a target range, thereby minimizing hyperglycemia‑induced endothelial dysfunction, atherogenesis, and other metabolic disturbances that increase cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.
Glucose Level - Glucose level denotes the concentration of glucose in a blood specimen, expressed in milligrams per deciliter or millimoles per liter. In cardiovascular practice it is a quantitative biomarker of metabolic status, with elevated values indicating hyperglycemia that contributes to atherosclerotic risk and disease progression.
Metabolic Risk Factor - Metabolic risk factor denotes a physiological or biochemical abnormality—such as elevated fasting glucose, insulin resistance, atherogenic dyslipidemia, central obesity, or impaired glucose tolerance—that independently increases an individual’s probability of developing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. It differs from metabolic syndrome, which is a defined cluster of such abnormalities, by referring to each constituent factor when considered singly or in any combination.
Lipid Disorder - Lipid disorder is a metabolic disease characterized by abnormal plasma concentrations or composition of lipoproteins—such as elevated low‑density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, or reduced high‑density lipoprotein cholesterol—that promote accelerated atherosclerosis and markedly increase the risk of cardiovascular events.
Dyslipidemia - An abnormal plasma concentration or composition of lipids and lipoproteins, typically manifested as elevated low‑density lipoprotein cholesterol and/or triglycerides, or reduced high‑density lipoprotein cholesterol, constituting a metabolic disorder that significantly increases the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.
Hyperlipidemia - Hyperlipidemia is a disorder of lipid metabolism manifested by plasma concentrations of cholesterol, triglycerides, or lipoprotein fractions that exceed established normal thresholds, thereby increasing the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. It is regarded as a modifiable risk factor for coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular events, and peripheral arterial disease.
Hypercholesterolemia - Hypercholesterolemia is a metabolic disorder defined by persistently elevated serum total cholesterol, especially low‑density lipoprotein cholesterol, which increases the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.
Hypertriglyceridemia - Hypertriglyceridemia is a metabolic disorder defined by fasting plasma triglyceride concentrations that exceed established reference values (generally >150 mg/dL). The condition reflects an excess of triglyceride‑rich lipoproteins, chiefly very‑low‑density lipoproteins and chylomicrons, and constitutes an independent risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. It is distinguished from hypercholesterolemia by the predominant elevation of triglycerides rather than cholesterol.
Adiposity - Excess accumulation of adipose tissue in the body, typically quantified by body mass index, waist circumference, or imaging measures, that reflects a state of heightened lipid storage. In cardiovascular contexts, adiposity constitutes a modifiable risk factor that contributes to atherogenesis, hypertension, and metabolic dysregulation.
Overweight - Excess body weight, defined by a body mass index ≥ 25 kg/m², denotes a condition in which adipose tissue accumulation exceeds physiologic norms and is recognized as a modifiable risk factor that elevates the likelihood of developing hypertension, dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, and other cardiovascular disorders.
Obesity - Obesity is a chronic, multifactorial condition defined by an excessive accumulation of adipose tissue, most commonly operationalized as a body‑mass index of ≥30 kg/m², that serves as a major modifiable risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure, hypertension, and cardiac arrhythmias.
Central Adiposity - Central adiposity denotes the excess accumulation of adipose tissue in the abdominal (visceral) compartment, typically quantified by waist circumference, waist‑to‑hip ratio, or imaging‑derived visceral fat volume, and reflects a heightened burden of metabolically active fat distinct from peripheral subcutaneous adiposity; it is recognized as an independent risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and related metabolic disturbances.
Visceral Adiposity - Visceral adiposity is the excess accumulation of adipose tissue within the intra‑abdominal cavity surrounding the internal organs, measurable by imaging modalities (e.g., CT, MRI, DXA) or validated anthropometric proxies such as waist circumference. It constitutes a metabolic risk factor that independently promotes insulin resistance, systemic inflammation, and atherogenic dyslipidemia, thereby increasing the incidence and progression of cardiovascular disease.
Central Obesity - Central obesity, also termed abdominal or visceral adiposity, denotes excess accumulation of intra‑abdominal fat measured by waist circumference or waist‑to‑hip ratio above sex‑specific thresholds. It is an independent cardiovascular risk factor that promotes dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, hypertension, and atherogenesis.
Physiologic Risk Factor - A physiologic risk factor is a quantifiable alteration in normal bodily function—such as hemodynamic, metabolic, or autonomic parameters—that exists prior to overt cardiovascular disease and is statistically associated with an increased incidence of heart disease. It differs from a clinical disease in that it does not constitute pathology itself but reflects a predisposition to future cardiovascular events.
Hypertension - Hypertension is a chronic cardiovascular condition characterized by persistently elevated arterial blood pressure, typically defined by systolic values ≥130 mm Hg and/or diastolic values ≥80 mm Hg on repeated measurements. It reflects increased peripheral vascular resistance or cardiac output and predisposes to target‑organ damage distinct from hypotension, which denotes abnormally low pressure.
Hypotension - Hypotension is a hemodynamic disorder characterized by arterial blood pressure persistently below the lower limit of normal (generally ≤90 mm Hg systolic or ≤60 mm Hg diastolic in adults) that may reduce coronary perfusion and precipitate myocardial ischemia.
Chronic kidney disease - Chronic kidney disease is a persistent impairment of renal function, defined by an estimated glomerular filtration rate below 60 mL/min/1.73 m² or evidence of kidney damage for at least three months, that disrupts fluid, electrolyte, and neurohormonal balance and thereby accelerates hypertension, atherosclerosis, and cardiac remodeling, acting as a major risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.
Renal failure - Renal failure is the progressive or abrupt loss of sufficient renal function to maintain homeostasis, resulting in impaired excretion of nitrogenous waste, dysregulation of fluid and electrolytes, and accumulation of metabolic toxins. In the cardiovascular domain, it is distinguished from acute kidney injury by its chronicity and from isolated electrolyte disorders by its primary impact on glomerular filtration rate. The condition serves as a major risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.
Obstructive sleep apnea - Obstructive sleep apnea is a sleep‑disordered breathing disease characterized by repetitive upper airway collapse during sleep, resulting in intermittent hypoxemia, arousals, and fragmented sleep. It is a recognized modifiable risk factor for hypertension, coronary artery disease, heart failure, and arrhythmias, and is distinguished from central sleep apnea by the presence of ongoing respiratory effort during apneic episodes.
Frailty - Frailty is a multidimensional clinical syndrome characterized by decreased physiological reserve and increased vulnerability to stressors, manifesting as unintentional weight loss, exhaustion, weakness, slowed gait, and reduced physical activity, which predisposes individuals with cardiovascular disease to heightened risk of morbidity, mortality, and adverse procedural outcomes.
Biomarker - A biomarker in cardiovascular medicine is an objectively measurable molecular, biochemical, imaging, or physiological parameter that quantitatively reflects the presence, severity, progression, or prognosis of heart disease, or the biological response to a therapeutic intervention. Unlike a clinical sign or symptom, a biomarker provides quantifiable data that can be monitored serially to inform risk stratification, diagnosis, or treatment efficacy.
C-reactive protein - C‑reactive protein (CRP) is an acute‑phase plasma protein produced by hepatocytes in response to interleukin‑6–mediated inflammation, serving as a quantitative biomarker of systemic inflammatory activity. Elevated CRP concentrations are independently associated with increased risk of atherosclerotic plaque formation, plaque instability, and subsequent cardiovascular events. It is measured in serum or plasma to aid risk stratification and therapeutic monitoring in cardiovascular disease.
N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) - N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide (NT‑proBNP) is the inactive N‑terminal fragment cleaved from the precursor pro‑BNP secreted by ventricular myocytes in response to myocardial wall stretch and increased intracardiac pressure. It serves as a circulating biomarker for the diagnosis, severity assessment, and prognosis of heart failure and other conditions associated with cardiac overload.
Hemoglobin A1c - Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) is a glycated form of the hemoglobin molecule measured in whole blood that reflects mean plasma glucose levels over the preceding 8–12 weeks. As a clinical biomarker, it quantifies chronic glycemic exposure and is employed to assess diabetes control and to stratify cardiovascular risk.
Serum creatinine - Serum creatinine is a quantitative blood biomarker representing the concentration of creatinine, a metabolic by‑product of skeletal muscle, used to evaluate renal excretory function; in cardiovascular practice it informs estimated glomerular filtration rate, guides dosing of renally cleared cardiac medications, and contributes to risk stratification in heart failure and acute coronary syndromes.
Clinical Measurement - A clinical measurement in cardiovascular medicine is a quantitative or semi‑quantitative value obtained through physical examination, imaging, laboratory analysis, or invasive monitoring that reflects cardiac structure, function, or hemodynamics. It is employed to assess disease severity, monitor therapeutic response, and guide management decisions, distinguishing it from purely qualitative observations or diagnostic classifications.
Physiologic Measurement - Physiologic measurement denotes an objective, quantitative assessment of a cardiovascular function or parameter—such as arterial blood pressure, heart rate, cardiac output, or systemic vascular resistance—obtained with validated instrumentation to evaluate the hemodynamic status of the patient.
Blood pressure - Blood pressure is the force generated by the circulating blood against the arterial walls, expressed as systolic over diastolic pressure in millimetres of mercury (mm Hg). It constitutes a clinical measurement that reflects cardiac output, vascular tone, and peripheral resistance, and is essential for evaluating hemodynamic status and cardiovascular risk.
Resting heart rate - Resting heart rate is the number of cardiac cycles per minute recorded when an individual is awake, seated or supine, and free from recent physical exertion, emotional stress, or stimulatory influences; it reflects intrinsic sinus node activity under basal autonomic tone and serves as a clinical measurement of baseline cardiovascular function.
Anthropometric Measurements - Anthropometric measurements are quantitative assessments of body size, shape, and composition, including height, weight, body mass index, waist circumference, and skinfold thickness. In cardiovascular care they are employed to stratify obesity‑related risk, monitor therapeutic interventions, and inform prognostic estimation.
Body mass index - Body mass index (BMI) is a calculated clinical measurement obtained by dividing a person’s weight in kilograms by the square of height in meters (kg/m²) that quantifies overall adiposity. In cardiovascular practice, BMI serves as an anthropometric risk factor because elevated values correlate with increased incidence of hypertension, dyslipidemia, coronary artery disease, and heart failure.
Waist circumference - Waist circumference is the anthropometric measurement obtained at the narrowest point between the lower costal margin and the iliac crest (or at the level of the umbilicus) that quantifies abdominal adiposity. It is used as a clinical metric of central obesity and is recognized as an independent risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and related adverse outcomes.
Waist-hip ratio - Waist‑hip ratio is the quotient obtained by dividing a person’s waist circumference by their hip circumference, providing an anthropometric index of central adiposity. In cardiovascular medicine it is employed as a risk factor indicator for atherosclerotic disease, hypertension, and metabolic syndrome, distinguishing abdominal fat distribution from overall obesity.
Electrocardiogram - Electrocardiogram is a non‑invasive diagnostic test that records the heart's electrical activity through surface electrodes, generating a time‑ordered waveform that reflects myocardial depolarization and repolarization. The resulting tracing is employed to identify arrhythmias, conduction disturbances, ischemic changes, and structural heart disease, distinguishing it from imaging modalities that depict cardiac anatomy rather than electrical function.
Functional Capacity - Functional capacity is the quantitative ability of the cardiovascular, pulmonary, and musculoskeletal systems to increase oxygen delivery and utilization during incremental physical activity, typically assessed by graded exercise testing or cardiopulmonary exercise testing. It reflects the integrated performance of cardiac output, peripheral oxygen extraction, and ventilatory efficiency, and is used to evaluate disease severity, prognosis, and treatment response in heart disease.
Functional Test - A functional test is a diagnostic procedure that evaluates the physiological performance of the cardiovascular system—often under exercise, pharmacologic stress, or imaging stimulation—to assess myocardial perfusion, contractile reserve, or electrical activity and identify functional impairment such as inducible ischemia, differentiating it from anatomic or structural assessments.
Diagnostic Test - A diagnostic test in cardiology is a clinically performed procedure, laboratory assay, or imaging study designed to detect, confirm, or exclude cardiovascular pathology, assess cardiac structure or function, and guide therapeutic decision‑making. It yields objective data that differentiate normal from abnormal cardiac states and may be used for screening, diagnosis, staging, or monitoring of heart disease.
Intervention - A cardiovascular intervention is a therapeutic or procedural action undertaken to prevent, diagnose, treat, or mitigate cardiac disease, encompassing pharmacologic therapy, surgical or percutaneous procedures, and structured lifestyle modifications, and is distinguished from passive observation or monitoring.
Lifestyle Intervention - A lifestyle intervention is a structured, non‑pharmacologic program designed to modify behaviors such as diet, physical activity, tobacco use, and alcohol consumption with the goal of reducing cardiovascular risk factors and improving clinical outcomes in individuals with or predisposed to heart disease. It is implemented as part of secondary or primary prevention strategies to influence modifiable determinants of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.
Therapeutic Intervention - A therapeutic intervention in cardiovascular medicine comprises any pharmacologic agent, device, surgical or percutaneous procedure, or structured lifestyle modification deliberately administered to prevent, ameliorate, or reverse cardiac pathology or its complications. It is employed with the explicit intent to alter disease trajectory, improve myocardial function, or reduce morbidity and mortality associated with heart disease.
Nutrition counseling - Nutrition counseling is a structured, patient‑centered behavioral intervention in which a qualified health professional provides individualized guidance on dietary choices, portion control, and nutrient intake to modify cardiovascular risk factors such as dyslipidemia, hypertension, and obesity. It differs from general nutrition education by incorporating motivational interviewing techniques, goal setting, and ongoing follow‑up to promote sustained dietary behavior change specific to heart disease prevention and management.
Weight Management - Weight management is the coordinated use of dietary, physical‑activity, behavioral, pharmacologic, or surgical interventions to attain and sustain a body weight that minimizes the risk of cardiovascular disease and its complications, distinguishing it from temporary weight fluctuations or isolated weight‑loss efforts.
Weight Loss - Weight loss, defined as a measurable decrease in body mass (commonly ≥5 % of baseline weight) over a specified period, is a modifiable clinical factor influencing cardiovascular risk. In the context of heart disease, intentional weight loss is employed as a therapeutic intervention to improve hemodynamic parameters, metabolic profile, and long‑term outcomes.
Clinical Management - Clinical management in cardiovascular care denotes the systematic planning, implementation, and coordination of diagnostic evaluation, therapeutic interventions, and longitudinal follow‑up intended to prevent disease progression, reduce morbidity, and optimize functional outcomes in patients with heart disease. It integrates evidence‑based treatment selection, risk stratification, and multidisciplinary care pathways, distinguishing it from isolated diagnostic tests or singular therapeutic procedures.
Diabetes management - Diabetes management comprises a multidisciplinary regimen of glycemic control through pharmacologic therapy, dietary modification, physical activity, and routine monitoring of glucose and related metabolic parameters, with the objective of preventing both microvascular and macrovascular complications. Effective management attenuates the increased risk of atherosclerotic coronary disease, heart failure, and cerebrovascular events that accompany chronic hyperglycemia.
Weight assessment - Weight assessment is the systematic measurement of a patient’s body mass, expressed in kilograms, performed to evaluate nutritional status, fluid balance, and body composition, factors that influence cardiovascular risk stratification and therapeutic management.
Statin therapy - Statin therapy is the chronic administration of 3‑hydroxy‑3‑methylglutaryl‑coenzyme A (HMG‑CoA) reductase inhibitors to lower plasma low‑density lipoprotein cholesterol, thereby reducing the incidence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction and stroke. It is employed as a primary and secondary prevention intervention in patients with elevated cholesterol levels or established coronary artery disease.
